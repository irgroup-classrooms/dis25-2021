# Student Talks on 2021-07-02 - Presentations of the project concepts

## Goal and core content of the presentation

Develop a **concept** and, if applicable, an initial prototype of a **NLP project** to **identify** one of the **forms of bias** presented in the papers/presentations in one of the **ESuPol datasets**.

Your presentation should include your thoughts on the following components of the project:
* Problem statement/construct: What **form of bias** do you want to investigate? 
* Choice of data set: Which of the **datasets** do you want to study (and why)? Which data from the dataset do you need for your analysis (complete/ only certain terms/ time-limited/...)?
* Formulate appropriate, precise **research question(s)**. There are many guides to formulating research questions, e.g., https://www.citavi.com/en/planned-accidents/articles/how-to-formulate-a-research-question
* Choice of **methods**: 
  * data preparation
  * Methods of analysis (and metrics) and possible statistical tests (e.g., significance tests).
  * Discussion of expected problems and hoped-for results.

For the evaluation it is crucial that you present a proper concept, with a sensible structure, in an understandable way and, if applicable, show already by means of first prototypes/testing that your project is feasible. Justify your decisions for each of the above-mentioned components of your project in a comprehensible way. It is important to be clear: How can you identify the chosen form of bias with which methods in which data? Since your final exam performance in this course is the implementation of your project, it makes sense to test the feasibility of your idea as much as possible. Therefore, ideally test your approach or individual components with the available test samples of the datasets.
